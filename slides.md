### Turing Machine as a Fundamental Computer Architecture

- Invented by Alan Turing in 1936

- Has a tape and read/write head

- 		It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence. If this machine U is supplied with the tape on the beginning of which is written the string of quintuples separated by semicolons of some computing machine M, then U will compute the same sequence as M.
		- Alan Turing

-		Turing's paper ... contains, in essence, the invention of the modern computer and some of the programming techniques that accompanied it.
		- Minsky

### Codecast

- Memory visualizing tool for C learners

### Notes

- //! showMemory(start=65520) for stack

- //! showMemory(start=272) for heap

- Int variables are initialized to 0 automatically. This is tool specific and variables may not be initialized automatically in other environments. So, it's a good practice to always intialize them with 0 manually
